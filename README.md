# Climate-Analysis
Visualizing Climate Change: Temperature Anomalies and CO2 Levels
Import Libraries and Load Dataset
Libraries :  In any data analysis, we need tools to manage, process, and visualize data. Python libraries commonly used for these tasks are:
Pandas: For handling and manipulating tabular data.
Numpy: For performing numerical calculations and handling arrays.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Load the dataset	
df = pd.read_csv('climate_data.csv')
Here, you load the dataset, which is expected to contain columns like Year, CO2 Levels, and Temperature Anomalies. These variables will help us study how changes in CO2 levels over time relate to temperature anomalies (which indicate climate change).
2. Understand the Dataset
Before analyzing, it’s important to understand the structure of the dataset. This includes viewing the data, checking data types, and understanding its overall contents.
`head()’: Displays the first few rows to understand the general structure.
`info()`: Gives an overview of columns, data types, and missing values.
`describe()`: Provides summary statistics (mean, max, min, standard deviation) for numerical columns, giving insight into data distribution.
3. Handle Missing Data
Missing data can skew analysis or even make some models fail. There are two main approaches to handle missing data:
Drop Missing Values: You can remove rows with missing data if the number of missing values is small, and it won’t affect the analysis.
Impute Missing Values: If missing data is more widespread, you can replace missing values with meaningful alternatives (like the mean or median of the column).
By handling missing data, we ensure that the analysis remains reliable and accurate.
4. Data Types and Conversion
Sometimes, data is not in the right format. For instance, Year might be read as a float or object instead of an integer. It's important to make sure the data types match the type of analysis we want to perform.
In this case, the `Year` column is converted to an integer because it’s a discrete numerical variable that represents time.
5. Univariate Analysis (Single Variable Analysis)
Univariate analysis involves examining the distribution of individual variables, one at a time. This helps us understand their characteristics (e.g., range, central tendency, spread).
Histograms: A common tool for understanding the distribution of continuous data. A histogram of  temperature anomalies shows how frequently certain temperature deviations occur.
Similarly, you can create a histogram for CO2 Levels, which will show the frequency of different CO2 levels over time.
This helps us see how the data is distributed, whether it's normally distributed, skewed, or has any anomalies (e.g., high concentrations of CO2 at certain levels).
6. Bivariate Analysis (Two-Variable Analysis)
Bivariate analysis  involves analyzing the relationship between two variables. For climate data, you are interested in how changes in CO2 levels (independent variable) correlate with changes in temperature anomalies (dependent variable).
Scatter plots: These are useful for visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables. In this case, you use a scatter plot to see how CO2 levels relate to temperature anomalies.
If CO2 levels are contributing to climate change, we might see a positive correlation 
where higher CO2 levels correspond with higher temperature anomalies.
Correlation coefficient: The correlation coefficient (usually Pearson’s) measures the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. A coefficient closer to 1 indicates a strong positive relationship, while a value near -1 indicates a strong negative relationship.
This helps quantify how closely CO2 levels are related to temperature changes.

7. Multivariate Analysis (Multiple Variables)
When analyzing more than two variables, multivariate analysis helps us see relationships across multiple dimensions.
Line plot over time: A line plot of CO2 levels and temperature anomalies over time helps visualize how both variables have evolved over the years, showing long-term trends.
This plot allows us to see whether there’s an upward trend in both CO2 and temperature, giving an overall picture of climate change.
8. Outlier Detection
Outliers are extreme values that can distort the analysis. One method of detecting outliers is using the Z-score, which measures how far a data point is from the mean. Values with a Z-score greater than 3 are often considered outliers.
Outliers in climate data might indicate abnormal periods, such as unusually high CO2 levels or temperature anomalies. Identifying them can help decide whether to remove them or explore these points further.
9. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new variables that can better capture patterns in the data. In this example:
CO2 Anomaly: You calculate the difference between each CO2 value and the mean, which gives an idea of how much CO2 deviates from the long-term average.
Year Categories: By dividing years into ranges, you can group data and analyze trends across different time periods (e.g., 1900–1950, 1951–2000).
These engineered features can be helpful in further analysis and visualizations.
10. Data Visualization
Finally, data visualization is crucial for communicating insights. It can help reveal patterns that may not be obvious from numerical analysis alone.
Line plot for CO2 anomaly: Shows how CO2 levels deviate from the mean over time.
Box plot for temperature anomalies by year category: Shows how temperature anomalies vary across different time periods, giving insights into how the climate has changed over decades. These visualizations make complex relationships more understandable and provide clear evidence of trends related to climate change.
