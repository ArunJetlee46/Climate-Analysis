Climate Analysis Summary :
1. Import Libraries & Load Data :

Use Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

Load the dataset (climate_data.csv) containing Year, CO2 Levels, and Temperature Anomalies.

2. Understand the Dataset :

Inspect the dataset using head(), info(), and describe() to understand its structure, data types, and summary statistics.

3. Handle Missing Data :

Identify missing values with isnull().sum().

Either drop rows with missing data or impute missing values (e.g., using mean or median).

4. Data Types & Conversion :

Ensure columns like Year are in the correct format (e.g., convert to integer).

5. Univariate Analysis :

Analyze individual variables using histograms to understand their distribution (e.g., frequency of temperature anomalies or CO2 levels).

6. Bivariate Analysis :

Use scatter plots to visualize the relationship between CO2 levels and temperature anomalies.

Calculate the correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson’s) to quantify the strength of the relationship.

7. Multivariate Analysis :

Create line plots to show trends over time for both CO2 levels and temperature anomalies.

Analyze how multiple variables evolve together.

8. Outlier Detection :

Identify outliers using methods like Z-scores to detect extreme values that may skew analysis.

9. Feature Engineering :

Create new variables like CO2 Anomaly (deviation from mean) or group years into categories (e.g., 1900–1950, 1951–2000) for deeper insights.

10. Data Visualization :

Use line plots, box plots, and other visualizations to communicate trends and patterns effectively.

Highlight long-term changes in CO2 levels and temperature anomalies to demonstrate climate change.

Key Insights :
CO2 Levels & Temperature Anomalies: A positive correlation is expected, where higher CO2 levels correspond to higher temperature anomalies.

Long-Term Trends: Visualizations will likely show an upward trend in both CO2 levels and temperature anomalies over time, indicating climate change.

Outliers: Extreme values may represent unusual events (e.g., volcanic eruptions or industrial shifts) that impacted CO2 or temperature.

This analysis provides a clear understanding of the relationship between CO2 levels and temperature anomalies, helping to visualize and quantify the impact of climate change over time.
